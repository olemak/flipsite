# Flipsite
## A designer friendly stylebuilder centered around progressive enhancement and sanity preservation

Web design does not have to be so difficult. Lay down a solid typography, pick out a nicely balanced palette, adjust pick an icon set... and you're more than halfway there.

Slide the slidy things, fill in the fillables, select the selecables, and you'll have the basics of your site design in place in minutes.

## Core principles
Flipsite will build two styles: a stripped back, basic version that works very well in all browsers, and an enhanced version with bells and whistles.
